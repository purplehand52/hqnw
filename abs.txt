Quantum networks will serve as an essential tool for the realization of quantum
communication, distributed quantum computing, quantum key distribution and many
such applications. These networks will become necessary to make quantum
computing accessible to academicians and public-users worldwide.

Existing work on quantum networks chiefly focusses on simple peer-to-peer
networks with arbitrary graph structures and simple topologies, and possible
routing mechanisms for qubit transfer amongst nodes via entanglement swapping.
However, classical networks are often organized in a hierarchical manner with
more centralization, resulting in efficient routing and communication.

We propose a hierarchical quantum network architecture by utilizing classical
network principles for hierarchy and unique entanglement pair assignment amongst
end-users using a centralized node which generates entangled pairs for the
entire network. We also look at the limitations posed by noisy channels
contributing to constraints on fidelity and introduce a routing solution to
account for these limitations while maximizing the demands satisfied. We also
briefly explore a mechanism to generate virtual edges for quick routing of
qubits in the network through our proposed apparatus.
